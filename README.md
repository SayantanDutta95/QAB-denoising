# QAB-denoising
Signal and image denoising using quantum adaptive transformation.




To whom it may concern,

This package includes the MATLAB code for the paper:
 
Sayantan Dutta, Adrian Basarab, Bertrand Georgeot, and Denis Kouam√©.
"Quantum mechanics-based signal and image representation: application to denoising." 
arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.01078 (2020).

This script shows an example of calling our denoising algorithm for signal and image
using Quantum adaptative basis (QAB).

N.B.: the code is not well optimized, it consumes a considerable amount of memory and
takes some minutes to generate the results. Please guarantee your computer have at least
16 GB of RAM if you want to denoise an image of size 512 x 512 (e.g., the classic Lena image).

Please feel free to contact me through the E-mail address if you have any questions.

Cheers,
